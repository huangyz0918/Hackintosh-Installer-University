:loudspeaker: This is an open source tutorial & information collector for Hackintosh installations that does not charge readers any fee. 

:loudspeaker: We don't want to build a universal installation tutorial and, it's also impossible since every devices are different. We are here because we want to gather information and experiences, we want to build an index for most successful builds in github and make them be discovered more easily. When I was just a newbie, I didn't know how to get start building a hackintosh since I didn't know what's a bootloader and an EFI partition. It took me a really long time to find a helpful build in Github due to the deep location of that repo. So this is the purpose why we created this index.

:loudspeaker: As we know, Hackintosh is potentially illegal because doing this is in violation of the end-user license agreement [(EULA)](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macosx107.pdf) from Apple for macOS. Therefore, we just focus on the technologies related to Hackintosh and do not use it commercially. If you want to get started, please first read this license in detail and remember that you are a geek, not a criminal.

Here are some other language versions:

## What's Hackintosh ?

When Apple announced their switch away from the PowerPC architecture to Intel's processors and chipsets, many were looking forward to having the ability to run Windows software on Apple hardware and Apple's operating systems on their non-Apple hardware. Apple was able to eventually build their Boot Camp feature in Mac OS X 10.5, later allowing Windows to run on Apple hardware. Those hoping to easily run Mac OS X on a standard PC didn't have it so easy.

Even though running Mac OS X on a generic PC is not supported by Apple, it is possible to accomplish given the right hardware and determination by users. Any system that is not made to run the Apple operating system is referred to as Hackintosh. This term comes from the fact that the software needs to be hacked in order to properly run on Non-Apple hardware. Of course some of the hardware needs to be tweaked in a few cases as well.

### **Contribute to tutorials**
The core part of this repo are tutorials, we distribute all of them into these parts:

- **Buyer's guide**

    In this part, you can get a quick idea of Hackintosh and get to know what hardware is suitable for installing Mackintosh on PC hardware. You can learn a lot about computer hardware like CPU, Hard Drives and graphics cards in this chapter. We keep these in the standalone folder `Hardwares`.

- **Bootloader Installation Guide**

    In this part, we will focus on the bootloaders of Hackintosh, you can gain knowledge about how a computer(PC) boots and how a operation system launches. We also cover information about the Clover Bootloader and Chameleon Bootloader here. We keep these in the `Bootloader` folder.

- **System Installation Guide**
  
    This is a introduction about macOS system installation. We keep these articles in the  `System` floder.

- **Post Installation Guide**

    This part is intended for post installation. Here, you can learn about basic drivers and kexts of your system and macOS. If you want to contribute to this part, please put your articles into `Post` folder.

- **Troubleshooting**

    We have a specific part for addressing issues, if you have any questions you can open an issue and ask for help from others. Also, if you want to share your experience about fixing some issues during hackintosh installation, you can contribute to this part. Don't forget to attach your hardware information and put your experience into `troubleshooting` workspace.

We will improve the workspace tree day by day, so don't forget to give us your precious suggestions !

### **Contribute to resource**
We encourage you to upload your hackintosh configs and kexts if you don't mind. This repo has a workspace named `Res` and you can make your own workspace there, and share your successful configs and kexts with others if you want. It's a good place to make a backup and share. Be sure to follow thses rules:

- Build your device folder under `Res` folder, named your device like this: `Computer brand-model-macOS  version`
- Put your device information into a markdown file: `info.md`.
- Put your configs in the root of workspace and create a `kexts` folder to hold all your kexts.
- For `kexts` folder, you can create different subfolders for different kinds of kexts, such as `Wifi`, `Graphics Cards` and so on.
- Please give links rather than uploading many large files.
- If you are a lazy person who get tired with creating so many folders, it's good for you to put the whole `EFI` along with your system kexts & information in your workspace.

A good example may look like this:

```bash

Res/
└── Lenove-B50-10.12.6
    ├── config.plist
    ├── info.md
    └── kexts/

```
A good `info.md` file looks like:

```markdown
- Device name: GA-Z170-Gaming 7
- CPU: i7-6700K
- Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 640
- Graphics: Intel HD4600

```

We are all looking forward to your resources! :+1:
