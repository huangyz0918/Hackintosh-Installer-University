Please stop and read this carefully. Otherwise your issue will be left **unaswered** and **closed**.

Issue tracker is _not_ a support forum, and if you have installation or usage problems, try asking your questions on [insancelymac.com](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/forum/643-lilu-and-its-plugins/) or [AppleLife.ru](https://applelife.ru/threads/zavod-intel-quick-sync-video.817923/page-132#post-720434). There could also be local communities providing IntelGraphicsFixup support in your native language.

If you have not working sound, and you **cannot** offer new resources that fix the problem for you, you should go to the **support forums**. Here there are no people who create custom audio resources, or who deal with installation issues.

When to use issue tracker:
* You have new resources or patches to add but cannot make a pull request
* You have kernel panics, crashes, hangs
* You want to discuss technical or legal stuff

_If you have a kernel panic, please ensure that you have a DEBUG version of the extension and you have `-v keepsyms=1 debug=0x100` boot arguments added. On 10.13 to avoid kext names scrolling over the panic log you should also [patch your kernel](https://applelife.ru/posts/686953)._
